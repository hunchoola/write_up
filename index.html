        <h1>The Power of Non-Verbal Communication in Kids</h1>
            <h4>I used My Nephew (Temiloluwa) as a case study</h4>
        <div id="article" class="content">
            

I recently observed a fascinating observation with Temiloluwa. Whenever he saw me, he would light up with excitement and eagerness to be carried. One day, I decided to test his reaction by not smiling or making funny faces. Instead of laughing, he made an unhappy noise, trying to get my attention.
<br><br>

This simple experiment taught me that babies rely heavily on our facial expressions and tone of voice to understand our emotions and intentions.
<br><br>

 Further research confirmed that this is a well-documented issue.

<b>My Message to Parents:</b>
<br>

As parents, it's essential to be mindful of our emotions and body language around our toddlers. Sometimes, our children cry or become upset because they sense our stress, fear, or worry. By managing our moods and being more aware of our non-verbal cues, we can create a more positive and calming environment for our children.
